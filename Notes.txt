### Notes 

1. Find a way to make Body.vue the main container
  -> I want to be able to place all the components in here

2. Set up the main website elements
  - Users component
  - Sidebar
  - Footer
  - All sections


Problem sidebar:
- When horizontal not all elements fit on it -> ... more option needed
